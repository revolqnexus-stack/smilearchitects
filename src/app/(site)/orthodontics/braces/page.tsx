      "The most commonly used fixed appliance. Stainless steel brackets are bonded to the outer tooth surface and connected by a metal archwire. Highly effective for all degrees of crowding, spacing and bite problems.",
    suitableFor: "All ages and most cases, including complex bite corrections",
    notes: "Durable, cost-effective, and reliably predictable for a wide range of problems.",
  },

    title: "Ceramic Braces",
    description:
      "Tooth-coloured ceramic brackets that blend with the natural colour of teeth. The archwire may also be tooth-coloured. Aesthetically more discreet than metal braces while working on the same mechanical principle.",
    suitableFor: "Adults and older teenagers who prefer a less noticeable appliance",
    notes: "Slightly more delicate than metal brackets. Oral hygiene instruction is particularly important.",
  },
  {
    title: "Damon / Self-Ligating Braces",
    description:
      "Self-ligating brackets use a built-in clip mechanism instead of elastic ties to hold the archwire. This may reduce friction and can allow for more comfortable tooth movement in some cases.",
    suitableFor: "Patients where reduced friction and fewer elastic tie changes are preferred",

  },
  {
    step: "3",
    title: "Brace Fitting",
    description:
      "Brackets are bonded to the teeth using dental adhesive, and the archwire is inserted. The appointment typically takes 45–90 minutes. Some soreness for a few days afterwards is normal as teeth begin to move.",
  },
  {
    step: "4",
    title: "Regular Adjustments",
    description:
      "Appointments every 4–8 weeks to change the wire, replace elastic ties, and monitor progress. Each appointment takes around 20–30 minutes.",
  },
  {
    step: "5",
    title: "Brace Removal and Retention",
    description:
      "Once treatment is complete, the braces are removed and retainers are fitted. Retainers are essential to maintain the result — teeth will shift without them.",
  },

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "At what age should my child have an orthodontic assessment?",
    a: "An initial orthodontic assessment from around age 7–9 is generally useful — this is when a mix of milk and permanent teeth allows the orthodontist to identify emerging bite issues. Early assessment does not always mean early treatment, but it allows appropriate monitoring and timely intervention if needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do braces hurt?",
    a: "Most patients experience some soreness and sensitivity for a few days after fitting and after each adjustment appointment. This is normal and is caused by the gentle pressure moving the teeth. Over-the-counter pain relief is usually sufficient. Discomfort typically settles within a few days.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long will I need to wear braces?",
    a: "Treatment duration varies from around 12 months for simple cases to 24–30 months for more complex situations. Your orthodontist will give an estimated duration after assessing your specific case.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can adults have braces?",
    a: "Yes. Adult orthodontic treatment is very common and can be just as effective as treatment in younger patients, provided teeth and gums are healthy. The main difference is that adults do not have the advantage of active jaw growth. All appliance types — including more discreet options like ceramic braces, lingual braces or clear aligners — are available.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I don't wear my retainer after treatment?",
    a: "Teeth have a natural tendency to drift back towards their original positions. Without consistent retainer wear, this relapse can occur — sometimes within months. Retainers are prescribed as part of every orthodontic treatment. Full-time wear is usually required initially, transitioning to night-time wear long-term.",
  },

                    Fixed braces are bonded to the outer surfaces of the teeth and work continuously —
                    without relying on the patient to remember to insert or wear them. Brackets and an
                    archwire create controlled, sustained pressure to move teeth precisely into the planned
                    positions.
